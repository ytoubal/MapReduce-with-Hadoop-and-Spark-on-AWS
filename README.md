# People You May Know

Running the code with the jar file is the easiest way to run the code without even needing Hadoop configured in the environment. The only requirement is Java to run the jar file and a Linux environment. 

The jar file is located in the out/artifacts/PeopleYouMayKnow_jar/ directory and the command to run it is simply:

java -jar PeopleYouMayKnow.jar path/to/input/file path/to/output/directory
